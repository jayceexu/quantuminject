The requirement for this program is on: http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/CSE508/hw/hw4.txt

Part 0: Environment

Run the quantuminject on VM and use the browser in host OS.
Run the quantumdetect on VM, it can detect the attack.
This has been tested successfully on Mac OS host and Ubuntu guest.

Compiler: g++ (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) 4.6.3

!Caution: It SHOULD be ran on separete OS (one in VM, one in host), 
          as professor Michalis suggest.


Part 1: quantuminject

1.1 Usage:

Command:

        sudo ./quantuminject -i eth0 -r "baidu" -d conf/inject.conf tcp

After typing this command, and quickly use the browser to type the url:
www.baidu.com
Then it will display the hacked webpage with red font.

1.2 Implementation:

By using libnet api to accomplish constructing a fake packet.
libnet_build_tcp/libnet_build_ipv4/libnet_build_ethernet
to build the tcp/ip/ethernet respectively.

And using pcre library to complete the regular expression part.

Among above, I use (TH_PUSH | TH_ACK | TH_FIN) flags to set in the tcp header,
don't forget the TH_FIN, as it explicitly close the connect so that 
no further true packets can be arrived.

For the conf.cc/conf.h, I cited some code from the airpwn for utility use, 
to read configuration and html file.

Part 2:

1.1 Usage:

Command:

Detect from ethernet:

       sudo ./quantumdetect -i eth0 tcp

Detect from pcap file:

       sudo ./quantumdetect -r testdata.pcap tcp

The command is similar as the HW2. After that it will indicate which packet is fake
packet and which is true one.

1.2 Implementation:

Most of the part derives from the HW2 except that it adds a hashmap to store and 
retrieve the key-value pair.

The key is (dest-ip << 32 | seq-number), the value is payload content.

Each time on the pcap_callback, it will check if the key exists, if not, it will 
insert it into the hashmap. If so, it will check if the payload matches the orignal
one. 
If the content matches the original one, it will ignore.
If the content doesn't match, it will regard the new packet as the true packet, 
and the previous content as the fake one. And then print the warning message.



Sample output:
I provide  a sample file "testdata.pcap". After running the quantumdetect, 
the results are shown as follows:
